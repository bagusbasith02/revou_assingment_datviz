							<h1>RevoU Data Visualization Assignment</h1>
						</header>
						<h2>Project Summary</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis for intermediate assignment. Found interesting insight and told the story as concise as possible.</li>
							<li>Visualized data for each findings using best data visualization practice to make sure data presented was easy to interpret by common people.</li>
							<li>Created interactive dashboards for each intermediate and advanced assignment and make sure the data presented on the dashboard was right on target and usable for stakeholders.</li>
							<li>Created presentation deck to compile the work done.</li>
					  	</ol>

						<h2>Insights</h2>
						<b>Intermediate</b>
						<ol>
							<li>From January 2021 – January 2022, the number of orders experienced an upward trend. The number of orders reached its peak in November 2021 with 7,181 orders.</li>
							<li>Top 10 Sellers based on number of orders is mostly come from the region that have already decent selling product.</li>
							<li>Of the customer states that are in the top 5 rankings based on the number of customers, SP (Sao Paolo) ranks first with 6,807 customers, followed by RJ (Rio de Janeiro) in second with 3,472 customers, and MG (Minas Gerais) in third with 1,300 customer.</li>
							<li>Segmenting is carried out on the Payment Value from the Order Payments Dataset. Price group is divided into 4, 0-50 (low), 51-200 (medium), 201-500 (high), 501-1000 (very high), and >=1001 (highest). The price group with the highest demand is the high price group with a price range of 51-200 which has a total order of 30,904.</li>

						<h2>Project Background</h2>
						<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">

						</div><br>
						<p>Data visualization is useful for data cleaning, exploring data structure, detecting outliers and unusual groups, identifying trends and clusters, spotting local patterns, evaluating modeling output, and presenting results. It is essential for exploratory data analysis and data mining to check data quality and to help analysts become familiar with the structure and features of the data before them. To test our capability in data visualization, we need to visualize some data in the intermediate assignment. I am going to use tableau public and Google Looker Studio.</p>

				<!-- Three -->
				<section id="three">
					<h2>Data Scope, Goals & Objectives</h2>
					<p>For intermediate assignment we used data from kaggle and provided by Sambar e-commerce company. The dataset has information of 49k orders from 2021 to 2022 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location.</p>
					<h3>Goals</h3>
					<p>Our goal is to learn how to visualize data with consice meaning, using tableau and google Looker studio. We also learn how to create beautiful and interactive dashboards.</p>
					<h3>Objectives</h3>
					<ol>
					<li>Exploratory data analysis of dataset given and visualizing the findings with appropriate chart and best practice to make the data storytelling as consice as possible.</li>
					<li>Combining the visualization in dashboards. Solve client problem using dashboards to track their progress.</li>
